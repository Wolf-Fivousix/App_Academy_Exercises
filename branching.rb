#Now this file has completely changed and is conflicting with test_branch!
# Oh NO! What will happen when I try merging these two??? Whow knows!? We shall find out!


#This file is just a test file for branc-merging functionality.
# I have to branch out incoming features. This is an example.

# ====================
# We have resolved the conflict and decided that both things are important!
# Therefore we are keeping both changes!
