# Future questions:
- W4D4 Rspec:
	- What is "Self" doing here?
	- Why are we calling a function in the end of the spec and not inside the expect()?
		1. Example (W1D2 rspec_exercise_2 01_part_2_spec.rb):
		    - it "should call your previous 'substrings' method" do
		      - allow(self).to receive(:substrings).and_return(["a", "ab", "b"])
		      - expect(self).to receive(:substrings).at_least(:once)
		      - palindrome_substrings("ab")
		    - end
- W4D5 CSS Advanced Selectors:
	- Why use Pseudo Selectors instead of making a class? (When I don't want to make changes to my HTML? Example?)
