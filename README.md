# Future questions:
- W4D5 CSS Advanced Selectors:
	- Why use Pseudo Selectors instead of making a class? (When I don't want to make changes to my HTML? Example?)

- W5D3 SQL:
	- Is "CREATE INDEX Idx1 ON fruitsforsale(fruit);" a free-cost operation? Doesn't SQL have to scan the whole table first, in order to make that? If so, wouldn't be better to just "SELECT price FROM fruit WHERE fruit='Peach';" in the first place?
